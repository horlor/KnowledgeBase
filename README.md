Nowadays, we solve more and more of our tasks on the internet, we handle busi-ness or do the shopping, communicating and entertain ourselves online. It is not surprising then, that web applications are getting more and more popular. The modern singular page applications can offer the same opportunities as the traditional thick clients, but can run on many platforms, and do not have to been installed.

The information sharing webpages are particularly widespread, the wikis, which offers the knowledge in the forms of articles, like an encyclopedia, or the knowledge-bases, which achieve this using questions and answers.

Currently available knowledgebase sites are not really suitable for smaller groups, and do not assist in fast communication, so in my thesis I try to find a solution to this problem. The users can ask questions, submit answers to them, according to them the users will receive notification, I support the fast problem solving by using real-time communication.

For the implementation of the knowledgebase portal I created a multi layered application, it consists mainly a server created by ASP.NET Core and a client using the React Framework, these two elements are communication by using a REST API. I paid special attention to create a flexible architecture consisting independent components. To achieve this, I tried to find and apply special design patterns, which I will present in detail in my thesis.
